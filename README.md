### Snapsack problem:
0/1 recursive snapsack : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGfK-j9gAQA

idea: returning max between if we add each element or we skip it


Fractional Knapsack : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fractional-knapsack-problem/

idea: sort array by ratio (profit/weight), and include items from heighest to lowest, fully if possible, otherwise portion until full bag
